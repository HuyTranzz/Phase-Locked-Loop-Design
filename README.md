ðŸ“¡ Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) Design (using gpdk90nm)
Designed and simulated a complete Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) system using Cadence Virtuoso, including the following functional blocks:

Phase Detector (PD)

Charge Pump (CP)

Loop Filter (LF)

Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)

Frequency Divider

Each block was implemented at the schematic level, and system-level verification was performed through transient simulations to validate phase-locking behavior and frequency tracking performance.
